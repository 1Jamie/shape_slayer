    UPDATE_MESSAGES: {
        '0.2.1': 'Initial early access release! Please report any bugs you find at https://github.com/1jamie/shape_slayer/issues',
        '0.2.2': 'Refactored the code to be more modular and easier to maintain with classes. Now uses a base class for all players and subclasses for each class in their own files. This will make it easier to add new classes in the future and one class cant break the whole game.',
        '0.3.0': 'Added multiplayer support. Now you can play with up to 3 friends online. Please report any bugs you find at https://github.com/1jamie/shape_slayer/issues',
        '0.3.1': '- Fixed a bug where after starting a run solo you could no longer access the multiplayer menu. \n - Added seperate tracking for currency per player and currency earned in multiplayer is properly tracked and shared back to the client so when you play solo it is still there! \n - Same was done for upgrades so each class will have its upgrades and you can use them in mutliplayer and solo.',
        '0.4.1': '- Fixed bug that prevented single player instances from purchasing upgrades in the Nexus. (my bad, i really should have caught this before release of the multiplayer system < thanks you know who for the catch >)',
        '0.5.0': `**MAJOR UPDATE: Architecture & Quality of Life Improvements**

**Server Architecture Refactor:**
• Complete server rewrite supporting three deployment modes:
  - Single-threaded (default, 100-1,000 players)
  - Multi-worker (clustering with Redis, 1,000-5,000 players)
  - Slave mode (multi-server cluster, 5,000+ players)
• Automatic Redis management via Docker for multi/slave modes
• Worker health monitoring and dynamic load balancing
• New configuration system via environment variables
• New files: mp-server-master.js, mp-server-worker.js, config.js
• Fully backward compatible with existing deployments

**Damage Numbers Multiplayer Sync Fix:**
• Fixed damage numbers not appearing on clients in multiplayer
• Corrected coordinate handling for accurate positioning
• Added validation to prevent crashes
• Host now sees damage numbers for remote player attacks
• Debug flag system for troubleshooting (DebugFlags.DAMAGE_NUMBERS)
• Comprehensive automated test suite using Puppeteer

**Mobile UI & Responsive Design:**
• Health bar, XP bar, and room number display scale responsively
• Character sheet redesigned for mobile:
  - Scrollable content (touch and mouse wheel support)
  - Responsive sizing (92% height on mobile)
  - Scrollbar visualization
  - Auto-closes on death
• Death screen improvements:
  - Responsive font scaling (up to 1.5x)
  - 3-second input delay to prevent accidental restarts
  - Better stat display and layout
  - Improved multiplayer death screen with proper player ordering
• Gear tooltips use world-to-screen coordinate conversion
• Touch controls refined with better cluster visualization

**Class Configuration System:**
• Refactored all player classes to use centralized config objects
• ROGUE_CONFIG, WARRIOR_CONFIG, TANK_CONFIG, MAGE_CONFIG
• All stats, cooldowns, and abilities configurable in one place
• Makes balancing changes much easier
• Upgrade bonuses and class modifiers properly integrated

**Ability Improvements:**
• Shadow Clones (Rogue): Health bars, can be damaged, health decay, visual fade
• Blink Decoy (Mage): Health system with bar, can be damaged, decay over time

**Character Sheet Enhancements:**
• Scrollable content for mobile
• Better stat breakdown (dodge charge sources, crit damage multipliers)
• Class bonuses section with dynamic descriptions
• More detailed gear display with affixes and class modifiers

**Other Improvements:**
• Better error handling and validation throughout
• Improved code organization and maintainability
• Performance optimizations for mobile devices
• Better separation of concerns (config vs implementation)`
