# Boss System Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create 5 unique boss encounters starting at room 10, each with intro sequences, weak points in hard-to-reach places, environmental hazards, and 3-phase combat progression.

## Architecture

- Create `js/boss-base.js` - Base boss class extending EnemyBase
- Create individual boss files for each encounter
- Add boss intro system to `main.js`
- Modify `level.js` to detect and spawn bosses
- Add environmental hazard system
- Add weak point damage multiplier system

---

## Phase 1: Boss Base System & Infrastructure

### 1.1 Create Boss Base Class

**File:** `js/boss-base.js`

**Tasks:**

1. Create `BossBase` class extending `EnemyBase`
2. Add boss-specific properties:

   - `isBoss: true`
   - `phase: 1` (1, 2, or 3)
   - `weakPoints: []` (array of weak point objects)
   - `environmentalHazards: []` (array of hazard objects)
   - `introComplete: false`
   - `introTime: 0`
   - `bossName: ''`

3. Add phase transition logic:

   - Phase 1: 100% - 50% HP
   - Phase 2: 50% - 25% HP
   - Phase 3: 25% - 0% HP

4. Add `checkPhaseTransition()` method
5. Add weak point collision detection
6. Override `takeDamage()` to check for weak point hits (3x damage multiplier)
7. Add environmental hazard update/rendering methods
8. Scale boss stats (5x HP, 2x size, 1.5x damage as per spec)

**Key Methods:**

```javascript
checkPhaseTransition()
checkWeakPointHit(x, y, radius)
addWeakPoint(x, y, radius, angle)
addEnvironmentalHazard(hazard)
updateHazards(deltaTime)
renderWeakPoints(ctx)
```

### 1.2 Boss Intro System

**File:** `main.js`

**Tasks:**

1. Add `bossIntroActive: false` to Game state
2. Add `bossIntroData: null` (stores current intro info)
3. Create `startBossIntro(boss)` function:

   - Sets `bossIntroActive = true`
   - Stores boss reference and name
   - Pauses game updates (boss frozen)
   - Sets intro duration (3 seconds)

4. Create `updateBossIntro(deltaTime)` function:

   - Animates boss entering from edge of screen
   - Displays boss name text
   - Handles intro sequence timing

5. Create `renderBossIntro(ctx)` function:

   - Dark overlay (80% opacity)
   - Boss appears, sliding in from spawn position
   - Boss name displays with text effect
   - "Press any key to continue" after 2 seconds

6. Add intro to game loop (before normal updates)
7. Allow player to skip intro with any key after 2s

### 1.3 Modify Room System for Bosses

**File:** `level.js`

**Tasks:**

1. Modify `generateRoom(roomNumber)`:

   - Check if `roomNumber % 5 === 0` AND `roomNumber >= 10`
   - If boss room, set `room.type = 'boss'`
   - Don't spawn normal enemies for boss rooms
   - Call `generateBoss(roomNumber)` instead

2. Create `generateBoss(roomNumber)` function:

   - Returns appropriate boss based on room:
     - Room 10: Swarm King
     - Room 15: Twin Prism
     - Room 20: Fortress
     - Room 25: Fractal Core
     - Room 30: Vortex

3. Boss spawns at center (400, 300)
4. Return boss in `room.enemies` array (single boss)

## Phase 3: Integration & Polish

### 3.1 Boss Rendering System

4. Boss contact damage (separate from weak points)

### 3.3 Environmental Hazard System

**File:** `js/hazards.js` (new file)

**Tasks:**

1. Create `EnvironmentalHazard` base class
2. Types: `Shockwave`, `DamageZone`, `PullField`, `Debris`

   - Damage value
   - Visual appearance

4. Update hazards each frame
5. Check player collision with hazards
6. Render hazards with appropriate effects

### 3.4 Boss Loot & Rewards

**File:** `js/level.js` and `js/gear.js`

**Tasks:**

1. Bosses guarantee rare+ loot drop (blue or higher)
2. Bosses drop multiple items (2-3 pieces)
3. Scale boss XP: 3x normal enemy of same type
4. Boss death triggers special particle effect

### 3.5 Testing & Balance

**Tasks:**

1. Test boss intro sequences skip properly
2. Verify weak point hit detection
3. Test environmental hazards don't stack unfairly
4. Verify phase transitions trigger correctly
5. Balance boss HP/damage for difficulty
6. Test all 5 bosses spawn at correct rooms
7. Verify boss room detection works (room % 5 === 0 && >= 10)

## File Structure Changes

**New Files:**

- `js/boss-base.js` - Base boss class
- `js/boss-swarmking.js` - Swarm King boss
- `js/boss-twinprism.js` - Twin Prism boss
- `js/boss-fortress.js` - Fortress boss
- `js/boss-fractalcore.js` - Fractal Core boss
- `js/boss-vortex.js` - Vortex boss
- `js/hazards.js` - Environmental hazard system

**Modified Files:**

- `js/main.js` - Add boss intro system
- `js/level.js` - Boss detection and spawning
- `js/combat.js` - Weak point damage handling
- `index.html` - Add new boss script tags

---

## Implementation Order

1. Boss base class and infrastructure
2. Boss intro system
3. Room system modifications
4. Individual boss implementations (one at a time)
5. Environmental hazard system
6. Integration and testing
7. Balance tuning

---

## Key Design Decisions

- Weak points deal 3x damage but aren't required (boss can be defeated normally)
- Environmental hazards persist for 0.5-2 seconds depending on type
- Boss intro can be skipped after 2 seconds
- Phase transitions trigger visual/audio feedback
- Bosses use existing particle and screen shake systems
