## Boss System

### Boss Architecture
Bosses extend `BossBase`, which extends `EnemyBase`. This inheritance pattern provides:
- Common boss functionality (phase system, weak points, environmental hazards)
- Base enemy systems (knockback, health bars, targeting, death logic)
- Unique boss implementations with specialized attacks and mechanics

### Boss Stat Scaling
All bosses are scaled relative to normal enemies:
- **HP:** 5x base HP × 1.3 (30% bonus) = 6.5x base HP (before room scaling)
- **Size:** 2x base size (visual and collision)
- **Damage:** 1.5x base damage
- **XP Value:** 3x normal enemy of same type

**Boss Base HP Values:**
- Swarm King: 195 base HP (final: 975 HP)
- Twin Prism: 156 base HP (final: 780 HP)
- Fortress: 234 base HP (final: 1,170 HP)
- Fractal Core: 195 base HP (final: 975 HP)
- Vortex: 260 base HP (final: 1,300 HP)

### 3-Phase Combat System
Each boss has three phases that change at HP thresholds:
- **Phase 1:** 100% - 50% HP - Opening moves, basic patterns
- **Phase 2:** 50% - 25% HP - Increased aggression, new attacks
- **Phase 3:** 25% - 0% HP - Maximum intensity, ultimate attacks

Phase transitions trigger visual/audio feedback and unlock new attack patterns.

### Weak Point System
- **Purpose:** Strategic targeting reward (not required to defeat boss)
- **Damage Multiplier:** 3x damage when hitting weak points
- **Visibility:** Weak points glow with cyan/white indicators
- **Accessibility:** Positioned in hard-to-reach locations (behind rotating body, at spike bases, center core behind pull field, etc.)
- **Collision Detection:** Weak points checked before normal body collision in damage calculations

### Environmental Hazards
Bosses create persistent environmental hazards during combat:
- **Shockwave:** Expanding rings from ground slams, persist 0.5-1s
- **Damage Zone:** Persistent area dealing damage (dash trails, spike zones)
- **Pull Field:** Constant force toward boss, reduces player movement speed
- **Debris:** Temporary collision zones from boss destruction/attacks

Hazards update each frame, check player collision, and auto-remove when expired.

### Boss Intro System
- **Trigger:** When boss room is entered and boss spawns
- **Duration:** 3 seconds total
- **Sequence:**
  - Dark overlay (80% opacity black)
  - Boss slides in from spawn position
  - Boss name displays with fade-in/scale-up text effect
  - "Press any key to continue" appears after 2 seconds
- **Skip:** Any key press after 2 seconds skips remaining intro time
- **State:** Boss frozen during intro, normal updates begin after intro completes

- **ESC:** Pause menu (different behavior in multiplayer)
- **G:** Interact with portal in Nexus (host only in multiplayer)

### Input Handling (Multiplayer)

#### Client Input Snapshotting
- **Critical Timing:** Input state must be snapshotted BEFORE `Input.update()` resets flags
- **Purpose:** Preserve `justPressed` and `justReleased` flags for host simulation
- **When:** In Nexus and during gameplay, clients snapshot input before each frame update
- **Storage:** Cached in `multiplayerManager.cachedInputSnapshot` for serialization

#### Host Input Simulation
- **Input Adapter:** Host creates `Input` interface adapter from serialized client input
- **Adapter Functionality:**
  - Converts raw input data (keys, mouse, touch) to `Input` interface
  - Handles touch controls (joysticks, buttons) for mobile clients
  - Preserves `justPressed`/`justReleased` flags for abilities
  - Maintains `lastAimAngle` for touch controls
- **Remote Player Instances:** Host creates full player instances for each client
- **Simulation:** Host calls `playerInstance.update(deltaTime, inputAdapter)` with adapted input

#### Input Serialization
- **Keyboard:** WASD, arrow keys, space, shift, mouse buttons
- **Mouse:** Position (x, y) for aiming
- **Touch Controls:** Joysticks (movement, aim) and buttons (attack, abilities)
  - Serializes `active`, `magnitude`, `direction`, `justReleased` states
  - Includes `finalJoystickState` for press-and-release abilities
- **Timestamp:** Client timestamp included for RTT calculation

### Combat Philosophy
"Dark Souls meets Geometry" - Every action has commitment and can be punished.

### Attack System
- **Basic Attack:** Quick damage, short cooldown
- **Heavy Attack:** Higher damage, knockback, longer windup

- **Visual:** Trail effect

### Enemy Attack Patterns
All attacks are telegraphed:
- **Flash red** before attacks
- **Windup animations** before big attacks
- **Color changes** indicate attack type
- **Audio cues** (optional)

### Knockback System
- Enemies have a knockback system that persists across frames
- Knockback velocity decays over time (50% per second for quick recovery)
- Applied by heavy attacks (Ground Smash, AoE Blast) and special abilities
- Prevents enemies from immediately recovering from powerful attacks

### Strategic Combat Elements
- Positioning matters (tight corridors vs open rooms)
- Enemy combinations create dynamic encounters
- Telegraphed attacks allow skill-based dodging

## Multiplayer System

### Overview
Shape Slayer supports co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players using a lobby-based system with join codes. Multiplayer is completely optional - the game works perfectly in single-player mode without any server.

### Architecture

#### Host-Authoritative Design
- **Host** (first player to create lobby) runs all game logic:
  - Enemy AI and behavior
  - Combat calculations and damage validation
  - Loot generation and distribution
  - Room transitions and door state
  - Game state management
  - Player instance simulation (for remote players)
  
- **Clients** (other players) send input and render state:
  - Send input state (movement, attacks, abilities) to host at 30 FPS
  - Receive full game state from host at 30 FPS
  - Render at 60 FPS using client-side interpolation
  - Handle their own visual effects and UI
  - Local input prediction for responsive feel

#### State Synchronization
- **Update Rate:** 30 updates/second (network), 60 FPS (client rendering)
- **Host sends:** Complete game state including:
  - All player positions, HP, animations, states
  - All enemy positions, HP, states, AI state
  - All projectiles (position, velocity, lifetime)
  - Room number, door state, door waiting state
  - Ground loot (ID-based sync)
  - Death state (all players dead flag, dead players set)
  
- **Clients send:** Local player input state:
  - Position, HP, rotation (for validation)
  - Input state (keys, mouse, touch controls)
  - Animation states
  - Class-specific states
  - Client timestamp (for RTT calculation)

#### Interpolation System
- **Purpose:** Smooth 60 FPS rendering despite 30 FPS network updates
- **State Buffering:** Stores up to 15 state snapshots per entity
- **Adaptive Delay:** Adjusts interpolation delay based on network latency (100-200ms)
- **Extrapolation:** Predicts movement when updates are delayed (max 100ms)
- **Lerp Speed:** Adaptive speed (5-20) based on distance to target
- **Snap Distance:** 100px threshold - snap instead of interpolate if too far

### Lobby System

#### Lobby Creation
- **Code Generation:** 6-character codes (A-Z, 2-9, excludes confusing chars like O/0, I/1)
- **Capacity:** Maximum 4 players per lobby
- **Expiration:** Lobbies expire after 1 hour of inactivity
- **Host:** First player to create lobby becomes host

#### Lobby Management
- **Join Flow:** Enter code → connect to server → join lobby → select class → wait for host to start
- **Host Migration:** If host disconnects, next player automatically becomes host
- **Player Tracking:** Server maintains player list with IDs, names, classes, ready state

### Network Protocol

#### Message Types (Client → Server)
- `create_lobby` - Create new lobby
- `join_lobby` - Join existing lobby with code
- `leave_lobby` - Leave current lobby
- `game_state` - Full game state (host only, 30/sec)
- `player_state` - Local player input state (clients only)
- `game_start` - Start game from Nexus (host only)
- `enemy_damaged` - Client damage event (forwarded to host)
- `loot_pickup` - Loot pickup notification
- `heartbeat` - Keep connection alive (every 30s)

#### Message Types (Server → Client)
- `lobby_created` - Lobby created successfully
- `lobby_joined` - Joined lobby successfully
- `lobby_error` - Error (lobby full, not found, etc.)
- `player_joined` - Another player joined
- `player_left` - Player left lobby
- `host_migrated` - New host assigned
- `game_state` - Full game state from host
- `enemy_state_update` - Enemy HP/state update (from host)
- `player_damaged` - Player took damage (from host)
- `loot_pickup` - Loot picked up by any player
- `game_start` - Game starting (synchronized transition)
- `room_transition` - Room transition event (with revival data)
- `return_to_nexus` - Return to Nexus event

### Server Architecture

#### WebSocket Server (`server/mp-server.js`)
- **Port:** 4000 (WebSocket)
- **Dependencies:** `ws` library (Node.js)
- **Binding:** `0.0.0.0` (accepts connections from any network interface)
- **Role:** Lobby management and message relay (NOT authoritative game server)
  - Server does NOT run game logic
  - Server does NOT validate game state
  - Server only routes messages between clients
  - Host is authoritative for all game logic

#### Server Data Structures
- **Lobbies Map:** `Map<code, lobby>` - Stores all active lobbies
- **Player-to-Lobby Map:** `Map<WebSocket, code>` - Quick lookup of player's lobby
- **Lobby Object:**
  ```javascript
  {
    code: 'A3X9K2',
    host: WebSocket,  // Reference to host's WebSocket connection
    players: [{ ws, id, name, class, ready }],
    maxPlayers: 4,
    createdAt: timestamp
  }
  ```

#### Server Message Routing

**Host → Server → Clients:**
- `game_state` - Broadcast to all clients (except host)
- `enemy_state_update` - Broadcast to all clients (except host)
- `player_damaged` - Forward to specific target player
- `game_start` - Broadcast to all clients
- `room_transition` - Broadcast to all clients (except host)
- `return_to_nexus` - Broadcast to all clients (except host)

**Client → Server → Host:**
- `player_state` - Forward to host only
- `enemy_damaged` - Forward to host only (host validates damage)

**Client → Server → All Clients:**
- `loot_pickup` - Broadcast to all players (including sender)
- `player_joined` - Broadcast to all other players
- `player_left` - Broadcast to all remaining players
- `host_migrated` - Send to new host only

**Server-Generated Messages:**
- `lobby_created` - Sent to creator
- `lobby_joined` - Sent to joiner
- `lobby_error` - Sent to requester (not found, full, etc.)
- `heartbeat_ack` - Response to heartbeat

#### Server Operations

**Lobby Creation:**
1. Generate unique 6-character code
2. Generate unique player ID
3. Create lobby object with creator as host
4. Store in lobbies map
5. Send `lobby_created` confirmation

**Lobby Joining:**
1. Validate lobby code exists
2. Check lobby capacity (max 4 players)
3. Generate player ID for joiner
4. Add player to lobby.players array
5. Send `lobby_joined` to joiner
6. Broadcast `player_joined` to all other players

**Host Migration:**
1. Triggered when host disconnects
2. Next player in lobby.players array becomes host
3. Update lobby.host reference
4. Send `host_migrated` message to new host
5. Log migration event

**Message Validation:**
- Server validates sender is in a lobby
- Server validates host-only messages (game_state, game_start, etc.)
- Server checks WebSocket connection state before sending
- Server handles parsing errors gracefully

**Cleanup:**
- Old lobbies expire after 1 hour (checked every 5 minutes)
- Empty lobbies deleted immediately
- Disconnected players removed from lobby
- Player-to-lobby map cleaned up on disconnect

#### Client Configuration (`js/mp-config.js`)
- **Server URL:** Configurable (default: `wss://shape-slayer.goodgirl.software`)
- **Connection Settings:** Reconnect attempts (3), delay (2s), heartbeat (30s)
- **Lobby Settings:** Max players (4), code length (6)
- **Interpolation Settings:** Delay, buffer size, lerp speeds, snap distance

### Multiplayer Integration

#### Nexus Integration
- **Class Selection:** Each player selects class independently (can duplicate)
- **Portal Interaction:** Only host can start game (press G near portal)
- **Lobby UI:** Access via pause menu (ESC) in Nexus
- **Player Rendering:** All players visible in Nexus before game starts
- **Movement:** Host-authoritative (host simulates remote players in Nexus)
- **State Sync:** Host sends game state, clients send player state (same as gameplay)

#### Combat Integration
- **Damage Validation:** Host validates all damage (prevents cheating)
  - Clients send `enemy_damaged` events
  - Server forwards to host
  - Host validates and applies damage
  - Host broadcasts `enemy_state_update` to all clients
- **Enemy Sync:** Host simulates all enemies, clients render authoritative state
- **Projectile Sync:** Host creates and manages all projectiles
- **Loot Sync:** Host generates loot, clients render and notify on pickup
- **XP Sharing:** Each player gains XP independently when enemies die
- **Collision Detection:** Host checks all collisions (enemies vs all players)

#### Death System
- **Individual Death:** Players die independently (can spectate if others alive)
- **Revival:** Dead players revive at 50% HP when entering new room
  - Host signals revival in `room_transition` message
  - Clients revive local player if in `reviveePlayers` array
- **Game Over:** Only when all players are dead (host determines this)
- **Spectate Mode:** Dead players can spectate living players

### Communication Flow

#### Game Loop Communication

**Host (Every Frame):**
1. Update local player with `Input` object
2. Update remote player instances with input adapters
3. Update all enemies (AI, movement, attacks)
4. Update all projectiles
5. Check collisions (player attacks vs enemies, enemies vs players)
6. Serialize complete game state
7. Send `game_state` to server (throttled to 30/sec)
8. Receive `player_state` from clients (store for simulation)
9. Receive `enemy_damaged` events (validate and apply)
10. Broadcast `enemy_state_update` after damage

**Client (Every Frame):**
1. Snapshot input BEFORE `Input.update()` (preserves flags)
2. Update local player with `Input` object (for local prediction)
3. Serialize player state (position, input, class)
4. Send `player_state` to server (as needed)
5. Receive `game_state` from host (every ~33ms)
6. Apply game state (update enemies, projectiles, remote players)
7. Use interpolation for smooth rendering
8. Send `enemy_damaged` events when local player attacks

#### Message Flow Examples

**Starting Game:**
1. Host presses G near portal
2. Host sends `game_start` to server
3. Server broadcasts `game_start` to all clients
4. All clients transition to PLAYING state simultaneously

**Damage Event:**
1. Client detects attack hit enemy
2. Client sends `enemy_damaged` to server
3. Server forwards to host
4. Host validates and applies damage
5. Host sends `enemy_state_update` to server
6. Server broadcasts to all clients
7. All clients update enemy HP/state

**Loot Pickup:**
1. Client detects loot pickup
2. Client sends `loot_pickup` to server
3. Server broadcasts to all players
4. All clients remove loot from ground
5. Host equips gear on remote player instance (if host)

**Room Transition:**
1. Host detects all enemies dead
2. Host opens door and detects player on door
3. Host sends `room_transition` with `reviveePlayers` array
4. Server broadcasts to all clients
5. Clients revive dead players, reset positions
6. Host starts new room generation

### Performance Considerations

#### Network Optimization
- **Throttling:** State updates limited to 30/sec to reduce bandwidth
- **Minimal State:** Only sync active game state (no unnecessary data)
- **ID-Based Sync:** Enemies and loot synced by ID (robust to desync)
- **Input Compression:** Serialize only essential input data
- **Message Batching:** Multiple state updates in single message when possible

#### Client Performance
- **Interpolation:** Smooth rendering despite network jitter
- **Prediction:** Local input prediction for responsive controls
- **Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup of old state buffers
- **Latency Handling:** Adaptive interpolation delay based on RTT
- **Input Snapshotting:** Minimal overhead (just copying input state before update)

#### Host Performance
- **Player Simulation:** Host runs full player instances for all clients
- **Input Processing:** Host processes 4x input (one per player)
- **Collision Detection:** Host checks collisions for all players
- **State Serialization:** Host serializes complete game state every frame
- **Scaling:** Performance scales linearly with player count

### Connection Management

#### Reconnection
- **Automatic:** Up to 3 reconnection attempts
- **Delay:** 2 seconds between attempts
- **State Recovery:** Rejoin lobby on successful reconnect
- **Graceful Degradation:** Single-player continues if server unavailable

#### Heartbeat System
- **Interval:** Every 30 seconds
- **Purpose:** Keep WebSocket connection alive
- **Detection:** Server detects disconnections via missing heartbeats

### Data Structures

## Key Formulas

### Scaling
```javascript
// Enemy HP scaling
enemyHP = baseHP * (1 + roomNumber * 0.15)

// Enemy damage scaling
enemyDamage = baseDamage * (1 + roomNumber * 0.1)

// XP to next level
xpToNext = 100 * (level ^ 1.5)
```

### Damage Calculation
```javascript
finalDamage = (baseDamage * gearMultiplier) * (1 - targetDefense) * critMultiplier
```

### Loot Tier Chances
- Gray: 50%
- Green: 30%
- Blue: 15%
- Purple: 4%
- Orange: 1%

### Gear Stat Bonuses
- Gray: 0%
- Green: +20%
- Blue: +40%
- Purple: +70%
- Orange: +100%

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- HTML5 Canvas 2D for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- WebSockets (ws library) for multiplayer networking
- Node.js for multiplayer server
- No external client dependencies (game runs entirely in browser)

### File Structure
```

  /css
    style.css
```

### Enemy Architecture
The enemy system uses a modular inheritance pattern:
- `EnemyBase`: Common functionality (knockback, health bars, targeting, death logic)
- Individual enemy files: Each enemy type extends the base class with unique AI and visuals
- `BossBase`: Extends `EnemyBase` with boss-specific systems (phases, weak points, environmental hazards)
- Individual boss files: Each boss extends `BossBase` with unique attacks and mechanics
- Benefits: Easy to add new enemies/bosses, reduce code duplication, maintainable structure

---

## Art Style

### Visual Design
- Simple geometric shapes
- Clear shape recognition
- Color-coded systems (gear tiers, enemy types)
- Particle effects for feedback
- Minimal but polished aesthetic

### Color Schemes
- **Player Classes:** Distinct shapes + colors
- **Enemies:** Red-based danger palette
- **Loot Drops:** Tier-based colors
- **UI:** Clean, minimalist
- **Room Backgrounds:** Different colors per zone

---

## Debug Tools

### Debug Panel
A developer tool accessible from the browser console for testing and debugging:
- **Toggle:** `DebugPanel.toggle()` in console or `Ctrl+D` keyboard shortcut
- **Features:**
  - Current room number display
  - Quick warp buttons for rooms 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 (boss rooms highlighted in orange)
  - Custom room input field (1-100)
  - Warp button to jump to any room number
- **Usage:** Opens a panel in the top-right corner with green terminal-style UI
- **Purpose:** Quickly test boss encounters and room progression without playing through earlier rooms
