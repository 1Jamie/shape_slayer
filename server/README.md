# Shape Slayer Multiplayer Server

WebSocket-based multiplayer server for Shape Slayer game lobbies.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on port 4000 by default.

## Configuration

- **Port**: 4000 (WebSocket server)
- **Max Players per Lobby**: 4
- **Lobby Code Length**: 6 characters (alphanumeric)

## Server Features

- **Lobby Management**: Create and join lobbies with 6-character codes
- **Host Authority**: First player in lobby is host, controls game state
- **Host Migration**: If host disconnects, next player becomes host
- **Message Relay**: Relays game state from host to clients
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes lobbies older than 1 hour

## Production Deployment

For production, consider:
- Using environment variables for configuration
- Adding SSL/TLS support (wss://)
- Implementing rate limiting
- Adding authentication/authorization
- Using a reverse proxy (nginx)
- Monitoring and logging

## Environment Variables

You can customize the server with environment variables:

```bash
PORT=4000 npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use**: Change the PORT in mp-server.js or use PORT environment variable
- **Connection refused**: Make sure the server is running and firewall allows port 4000
- **Lobby not found**: Lobby codes are case-sensitive and expire after 1 hour
