## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for multiplayer server and optional development server)
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1jamie/shape_slayer.git
cd shape_slayer
```

2. **Single-Player Mode** (No server required):
   - Simply open `index.html` directly in your browser
   - The game works completely offline for single-player gameplay

3. **Multiplayer Mode** (Optional):
   - Install multiplayer server dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
   - Start the multiplayer WebSocket server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The server will run on port 4000 (WebSocket)
   - See the [Multiplayer](#-multiplayer) section for detailed setup instructions

4. **Development Server** (Optional, for testing):
   - From the project root, start the HTTP server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   - The game will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Useful for testing with proper HTTP headers and avoiding CORS issues

## üéØ Controls

- **WASD** - Move in 8 directions
- **Mouse** - Player rotates to face cursor
- **Left Click** - Basic attack (~0.3s cooldown)
- **Right Click** - Heavy attack (~1.5-2.5s cooldown)
- **Shift** - Dodge roll with i-frames (~2s cooldown)
- **Spacebar** - Class special ability (~5s cooldown)
- **ESC** - Pause menu (opens multiplayer menu in Nexus)
- **R** - Restart game
- **M** - Return to main menu
- **Skip/Click** - Skip boss intro sequences during presentation
- **Ctrl+D** - Toggle debug panel (for testing)

### Multiplayer Controls

- Controls are identical to single-player mode
- **Host-only actions:**
  - Only the host can start the game from the Nexus portal (press **G** near portal)
  - Host runs authoritative game logic; clients send input and render state
- **G** - Interact with portal in Nexus (host only to start game)

## üåê Multiplayer

Shape Slayer supports co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players using a lobby-based system with join codes. Multiplayer is completely optional - the game works perfectly in single-player mode without any server.

### Features

- **Lobby System** - Create or join lobbies with 6-character codes (e.g., "A3X9K2")
- **Host Authority** - Host player runs game logic; clients receive and render state
- **Full Synchronization** - All player animations, enemies, projectiles, and effects are synchronized
- **Class Flexibility** - Multiple players can use the same class
- **Graceful Fallback** - Game works 100% offline without a server for single-player
- **Automatic Reconnection** - Up to 3 reconnection attempts with 2-second delay
- **Host Migration** - If host disconnects, next player becomes host automatically

### Architecture

#### Host-Authoritative Design
- The **host** (first player to create lobby) runs all game logic:
  - Enemy AI and behavior
  - Combat calculations
  - Loot generation
  - Room transitions
  - Game state management
  
- **Clients** (other players) send input and render state:
  - Send input state (movement, attacks, abilities) to host
  - Receive full game state from host at 30 FPS
  - Render at 60 FPS using client-side interpolation
  - Handle their own visual effects and UI

#### State Synchronization
- **Host sends** (30 updates/second):
  - All player positions, HP, animations, states
  - All enemy positions, HP, states
  - All projectiles
  - Room number, door state
  - Ground loot
  
- **Clients send** (as needed):
  - Local player position, HP, rotation
  - Animation states
  - Class-specific states
  - Input state (for host simulation)

### Setup

#### 1. Install Server Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

This installs the `ws` WebSocket library required for the multiplayer server.

#### 2. Start the Multiplayer Server

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The server will start on port 4000 (WebSocket). You should see:
```
========================================
  Shape Slayer Multiplayer Server
========================================
  Local:    ws://localhost:4000
  Network:  ws://YOUR_IP:4000
  Status:   Running
========================================
```

#### 3. Start the Game Server (Optional)

In a separate terminal, from the project root:

```bash
node server.js
```

The game will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. This is optional - you can also open `index.html` directly, but the HTTP server helps avoid CORS issues during development.

#### 4. Configure Server URL (If Needed)

Edit `js/mp-config.js` to change the multiplayer server URL:

```javascript
const MultiplayerConfig = {
    // For local testing
    SERVER_URL: 'ws://localhost:4000',
    
    // For production with SSL
    // SERVER_URL: 'wss://yourdomain.com',
    
    // For LAN testing
    // SERVER_URL: 'ws://192.168.1.100:4000',
    
    // ... other settings
};
```

**Default production server:** `wss://shape-slayer.goodgirl.software`

### How to Play Multiplayer

#### Creating a Lobby (Host)

1. Open the game in your browser
2. Navigate to the Nexus (main hub area)
3. Press `ESC` to open pause menu
4. Click "Multiplayer" button
5. Click "Create Lobby"
6. Note the 6-character lobby code (e.g., "A3X9K2")
7. Select a class in the Nexus
8. Share the lobby code with friends
9. Other players can now join using the code

#### Joining a Lobby (Clients)

1. Open the game in a **new browser window/tab** (or different browser)
2. Navigate to the Nexus
3. Press `ESC` to open pause menu
4. Click "Multiplayer" button
5. Enter the 6-character lobby code
6. Click "Join Lobby"
7. Select a class in the Nexus
8. Wait for host to start the game

#### Starting the Game

1. Only the **host** can start the game
2. Host walks to the portal in the Nexus center
3. Press `G` when near the portal
4. All connected players will transition to the game together
5. All players see synchronized gameplay

### Technical Details

#### Interpolation System

The client uses a sophisticated interpolation system for smooth rendering:

- **State Buffering** - Stores up to 15 state snapshots
- **Adaptive Delay** - Adjusts interpolation delay based on network latency (100-200ms)
- **Extrapolation** - Predicts movement when updates are delayed
- **Smooth Rendering** - Clients render at 60 FPS despite 30 FPS network updates

#### Network Performance

- State updates throttled to 30/sec to reduce bandwidth
- Only active game state is synced (no unnecessary data)
- Heartbeat every 30 seconds to keep connection alive
- Automatic reconnection (up to 3 attempts, 2 second delay)

#### Message Types

**Client ‚Üí Server:**
- `create_lobby` - Create new lobby
- `join_lobby` - Join existing lobby
- `leave_lobby` - Leave current lobby
- `game_state` - Full game state (host only)
- `player_state` - Local player state (clients only)
- `game_start` - Start game (host only)
- `heartbeat` - Keep connection alive

**Server ‚Üí Client:**
- `lobby_created` - Lobby created successfully
- `lobby_joined` - Joined lobby successfully
- `lobby_error` - Error (lobby full, not found, etc.)
- `player_joined` - Another player joined
- `player_left` - Player left lobby
- `host_migrated` - New host assigned
- `game_state` - Full game state from host
- `player_state` - Player state from client
- `game_start` - Game starting

### Configuration

The multiplayer system is configured in `js/mp-config.js`:

```javascript
const MultiplayerConfig = {
    SERVER_URL: 'wss://shape-slayer.goodgirl.software',
    
    // Connection settings
    RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS: 3,
    RECONNECT_DELAY: 2000, // milliseconds
    HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 30000, // milliseconds (30 seconds)
    
    // Lobby settings
    MAX_PLAYERS: 4,
    CODE_LENGTH: 6,
    
    // Interpolation settings
    INTERPOLATION_DELAY: 100, // milliseconds
    MAX_INTERPOLATION_DELAY: 200,
    EXTRAPOLATION_LIMIT: 100,
    STATE_BUFFER_SIZE: 15,
    BASE_LERP_SPEED: 10,
    MIN_LERP_SPEED: 5,
    MAX_LERP_SPEED: 20,
    SNAP_DISTANCE: 100 // pixels
};
```

### Production Deployment

#### Server Hosting

1. Deploy `server/mp-server.js` to your hosting provider
2. Ensure WebSocket support (most providers support this)
3. Configure SSL for `wss://` (recommended for production)
4. Use process manager (PM2, Forever) for auto-restart
5. Update `js/mp-config.js` with production server URL

#### Security Considerations

- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement authentication if needed
- Validate all client inputs on server
- Monitor server logs for suspicious activity

- Hitting weak points deals **3x damage** instead of normal damage
- Weak points may be hidden or protected during certain boss attacks
- Optional mechanic - skilled players are rewarded with faster boss kills

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Multiplayer Connection Issues

#### "Failed to connect to server"
- **Check server is running:** Ensure the multiplayer server is running (`cd server && npm start`)
- **Verify server URL:** Check `js/mp-config.js` matches your setup:
  - Local: `ws://localhost:4000`
  - Production: `wss://shape-slayer.goodgirl.software`
- **Check firewall/port forwarding:** Ensure port 4000 is open (for WebSocket connections)
- **Network connectivity:** Test if you can reach the server URL in your browser's developer console

#### "Lobby not found"
- **Case sensitivity:** Lobby codes are case-sensitive - enter exactly as provided
- **Lobby expiration:** Lobbies expire after 1 hour of inactivity
- **Server restart:** If the server restarted, all lobbies are cleared (they don't persist)
- **Double-check code:** Verify you entered the correct 6-character code

#### "Lobby is full"
- Maximum of 4 players per lobby
- Wait for a player to leave or create a new lobby

#### Players not syncing properly
- **Check browser console:** Open developer tools (F12) and look for errors
- **Verify connection:** Ensure all players successfully connected (check lobby list)
- **Server logs:** Check server console output for disconnection messages
- **Network lag:** High latency may cause delays (system uses adaptive interpolation)
- **Firewall issues:** Ensure WebSocket connections aren't blocked

#### "Only host can start"
- This is intentional - only the first player (host) can start the game
- If host left, the next player automatically becomes host
- Check lobby list to see who is host (indicated with "(Host)")

### Server Setup Problems

#### Server won't start
- **Check Node.js:** Ensure Node.js is installed (`node --version`)
- **Install dependencies:** Run `cd server && npm install`
- **Port in use:** Check if port 4000 is already in use by another application
- **Permissions:** On Linux/Mac, ensure you have permission to bind to port 4000

#### Server starts but clients can't connect
- **Network binding:** Server binds to `0.0.0.0` by default (accepts connections from any interface)
- **Localhost vs Network:** Use `ws://localhost:4000` for local testing, `ws://YOUR_IP:4000` for LAN
- **Firewall:** Ensure firewall allows incoming connections on port 4000
- **Router/NAT:** For internet connections, configure port forwarding for port 4000

### General Game Issues

#### Game doesn't load
- **Browser compatibility:** Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **JavaScript enabled:** Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- **File protocol:** If opening `index.html` directly, some features may not work - use HTTP server instead
- **CORS errors:** Use the HTTP development server (`node server.js`) instead of opening file directly

#### Performance issues
- **Frame rate:** Check FPS in debug panel (`Ctrl+D`)
- **Too many players:** Reduce number of players in lobby (performance scales with player count)
- **Network latency:** High latency may cause stuttering (check connection quality)
- **Browser resources:** Close other tabs/applications to free up resources

For additional help, check the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console) and server logs for error messages.

## üêõ Debug Tools

### Debug Panel
Accessible via `DebugPanel.toggle()` in the browser console or `Ctrl+D`:
- Warp to specific rooms instantly (rooms 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 highlighted for bosses)
- Custom room input (1-100)
- Current room display
- Perfect for testing boss encounters without playing through earlier rooms

For questions or feedback, please open an issue on GitHub.
